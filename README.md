These are the various Complex modification JSON files for making my Ducky One
3 full size keyboard, plugged into a Mac Mini running macOS Sequoia version
15.0.1

This keyboard MUST be selected as type "ANSI (North America, most of Asia and
others) under the Virtual Keyboard settings section.

For the record here are the exact detauls from the USB output:

I have five scripts required so that the keyboard works with the OS, that is,
the right keys come out where you expect, for example the " and @ keys, one of
my pet hates!

# Using

Open the settings dialog, select 'Complex Modifications' and then, for each
script in the repo, cut and paste the contents and set the title.  And don't
forget to enable the rule.
